# cwrubotix_slachive_bot
A hack for stickin' it to the man.
======
### Description
This is a bot that will save messages from the CWRUbotix slack channel and make them available for later, so that we can archive more than 10,000 messages because the premium slack is hella expensive.

### About the Name
"slachive" is a portmanteau of "slack" and "archive."
